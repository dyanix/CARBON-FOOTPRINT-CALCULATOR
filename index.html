            &rarr; Carbon footprint is a very important means to understand the
            impact of a person's behavior on Global Warming. That's why someone
            who effectively wants to contribute to stop global warming, even on
            an individual scale, needs to measure and keep track of their
            personal carbon footprint.

        The national capital - Delhi has the highest annual carbon footprint in
        the country. In fact, Delhi's annual CO2 emission of 69.4 million tonnes
        is equal to the CO2 emission of Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai put
        together. When it comes to per capita CO2 emission, Chandigarh and
        Vadodara are far ahead of the rest with 3.9 tonnes and 3.5 tonnes
        respectively. The carbon footprint for a Mumbaiite was concentrated in
        the range of 0.51 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. Our analysis found
        that higher income groups have a higher carbon consumption lifestyle as
        compared to those from lower income groups. CO2 emissions are dominated
        by the burning of fossil fuels for energy production and industrial
        production of materials such as cement. Since India has the second
        highest population in the world i.e 17.5% of the worlds total
        population, this increases the consumption of food, energy, goods and
        services thereby resulting in the further increase of CO2 emission.
